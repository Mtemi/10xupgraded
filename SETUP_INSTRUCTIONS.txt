SETUP INSTRUCTIONS - After Extracting
===========================================

This project is a Remix/React application. Follow these steps to get it running:

PREREQUISITES:
--------------
1. Node.js (version 18.18.0 or higher)
   - Download from: https://nodejs.org/
   - Verify installation: node --version

2. pnpm Package Manager
   - Install: npm install -g pnpm
   - Verify: pnpm --version

SETUP STEPS:
------------
1. Extract the zip file to your desired location

2. Open terminal/command prompt in the extracted folder

3. Install dependencies:
   pnpm install
   
   (This will create the node_modules folder with all required packages)

4. Create environment file (if needed):
   - Check if you need a .env file for API keys, database URLs, etc.
   - Create .env file in the root directory
   - Add required environment variables

5. Run the development server:
   pnpm run dev

6. Open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal
   (Usually: http://localhost:5173 or similar)

BUILD FOR PRODUCTION:
---------------------
To create a production build:
   pnpm run build

Then start the production server:
   pnpm run start

AVAILABLE SCRIPTS:
------------------
- pnpm run dev      - Start development server
- pnpm run build    - Build for production
- pnpm run start    - Start production server
- pnpm run lint     - Run linter
- pnpm run typecheck - Check TypeScript types

NOTES:
------
- The node_modules folder was excluded from the zip to reduce size
- Build files were excluded as they can be regenerated
- .env files were excluded for security (you'll need to create your own)
- All source code and configuration files are included

If you encounter any issues, check:
1. Node.js version is correct (>=18.18.0)
2. pnpm is installed correctly
3. All dependencies installed successfully
4. Environment variables are set correctly
